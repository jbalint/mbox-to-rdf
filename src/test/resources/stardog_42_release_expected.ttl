	mbox:body """Folks,

We're very happy to announce the release of Stardog 4.2!

Stardog 4.2 rolls out a couple of new features: stored queries and
Blob Indexing and Text Enrichment with Semantics: BITES.

Stored queries [1] allows you to save queries and associate then with
a name and then execute those queries later on using only their name.

BITES [2] adds to Stardog a document storage subsystem unifying
unstructured data like text documents or images with the graph. How
data is extracted from unstructured content is completely configurable
by the user. There's a simple example [3] online.

This release also includes a variety of bug fixes, optimization and
query evaluation improvements, and support for UNION in Stardog Rules.

Finally, as of Stardog 4.2, we've decided to deprecate the SNARL
protocol [4]. As of this release, HTTP is the default protocol;
support for the SNARL protocol will be dropped in Stardog 5. Starting
in Stardog 5, the Stardog server will support only HTTP(s) & HTTP2.

For the full list of changes, please refer to the release notes [5].

Cheers,

The Stardog Team
